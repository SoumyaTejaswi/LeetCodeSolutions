Problem:Find the Maximum Achievable Number
Problem Description:
Given two integers, num and t. A number is achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation:
Increase or decrease the number by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.
Return the maximum achievable number after applying the operation at most t times.
Example:
Input: num = 4, t = 1
Output: 6
Explanation:
Apply the following operation once to make the maximum achievable number equal to num:
Decrease the maximum achievable number by 1, and increase num by 1.

Solution Code:
class Solution(object):
    def theMaximumAchievableX(self, num, t):
        """
        :type num: int
        :type t: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return num+t+t
